# Go API client for HAFAS (WIP)

Currently, only stop search and stationboard endpoints are implemented.
The only API which has been tested is the [ZVV](https://www.zvv.ch/) one.

It has the base URL <https://zvv.hafas.cloud/bin> and a nice web
interface at <https://online.fahrplan.zvv.ch/bin/stboard.exe>.
